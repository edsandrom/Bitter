# Project developed for the PHP Course in the IT - Programmer-Analyst program at NBCC - Class of 2020

# Bitter - Social media website using PHP.

The project was broken up into 6 different "sprints". 

Sprint #1 involved getting the website and database setup and building a functional registration page;
Sprint #2 involved building login/logout functionality and "following" other users;
Sprint #3 involved uploading photos, server-side form validation and data encryption
Sprint #4 involved making the website object-oriented and adding reply functionality to the website
Sprint #5 involved building a search page and implementing a web service.
Sprint #6 involved miscellaneous tasks to make your website more functional and realistic. These tasks may include "liking" a social media post and direct messaging another user.

It wasn't finished 100% correctly but it worked good and has some demonstration of PHP and SQL queries.
