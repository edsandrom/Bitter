// This PHP page is *called from* ajaxClient.php (STEP.4, Parameter 1) on the CLIENT side.  										
//																																	
// It receives the data you entered in your form via URL parameters. (STEP.4, Parameter 2)											
//																																	
// This page is *executed on* the SERVER side.  So, if "you" (the client) are located in Saint John, and the actual					
// YeS website (the server) is located in California, this page is executed IN California, not IN Saint John.						
//  																																
// This page is not designed to interact with your browser!  It should NOT contain any HTML.  Trying to place HTML into this		
// page will usually cause it to stop working, and you will not receive any indication of that (ie error message, etc).				
//																																	
// Basically then, this page receives data from ajaxClient.php, inserts it into a database table, retrieves it back (to make sure 	
// it's in the table), "encodes" it, and returns it to ajaxClient.php , which then displays it.
