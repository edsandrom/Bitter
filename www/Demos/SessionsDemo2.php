<?php
// This page assumes that it is being called from SessionsDemo1.php


	// 4. Start a session.  Every individual page that wants to use the shared session variables must do this.										
	// If a page does not need to use the session variables, you do not need to do this step.  It does not affect any existing session variables.	
	session_start();
	// Comment out the above to see the affect on the demo!
		   
// The session_start() declaration needs to go at the top of a PHP document before any HTML is sent to the browser.  The reason for this:
//		•	PHP Sessions create cookies
//		•	Cookies need to be sent in the HTTP header
//		•	The HTTP header is sent before the page document
//		•	Since a PHP script is interpreted in sequence, if any HTML (or other text/markup) is written to the page document, it is then too late to commit any changes to the HTTP header
